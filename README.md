## Why? ü§∑

<!--
You want a way to add authentication
to your Elixir/Phoenix App
in the fewest steps and least code.
We did too. So we built `auth_plug`.
-->

**_Frustrated_** by the **complexity**
and **incomplete docs/tests**
in **_existing_ auth solutions**,
we built **`auth_plug`** to **simplify** our lives. <br />

We needed a way to **_minimise_**
the steps
and **code** required
to add auth to our app(s).
With **`auth_plug`** we can **setup**
auth in any Elixir/Phoenix
App in **_less_ than 2 minutes**
with only **5 lines** of config/code
and **_one_ environment variable**.

### Pain üòß

We try to maintain a
["beginner's mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)
in everything we do.

There are virtually infinite options
for 3rd party Authentication.
Most are complex and unfriendly to beginners.
They require understanding the difference
between an authentication scheme, strategy or implementation.
We have used everything from
[black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box)
(closed source)
services that promise the world but are consistently
painful to setup, to open source projects that
are woefully undocumented and lack automated tests
so we cannot _rely_ on them.
We got tired of compromising on the UX of auth,
so we built _exactly_ what we wanted
as the "users" of our own product.

-->

## What? üîê

An Elixir Plug (_HTTP Middleware_)
that a _complete_ beginner can use to add auth to a
Phoenix App
and _understand_ how it works. <br />
No macros/behaviours to `use` (_confuse_).
No complex configuration or "implementation".
Just a basic plug that uses Phoenix Sessions
and standards-based JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Refreshingly simple. The way auth _should_ be done.

**`auth_plug`** protects any routes in your app
that require authentication. <br />

**`auth_plug`** is just
[57 lines](https://codecov.io/gh/dwyl/auth_plug/tree/master/lib)
of (_significant_)
[code](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug/tree/master/lib);
the rest is comprehensive comments
to help _everyone understand_ how it works.
As with _all_ our code,
it's meant to be as beginner-friendly as possible.
If you get stuck or have any questions,
please [**_ask_**!](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug/issues)

## Who? üë•

We built this plug for use in _our_ products/services.
It does _exactly_ what we want it to and nothing more.
It's tested, documented and open source the way _all_ our code is.
It's **not _yet_** a **general purpose** auth solution
that _anyone_ can use.
If after reading through this you feel that
this is something you would like to have
in your own Elixir/Phoenix project,
[**_tell us_**!](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug/issues)

# How? üí°

_Before_ you attempt to use the **`auth_plug`**,
try the Heroku example version so you know what to expect: <br />
https://auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/admin

![auth_plug_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/80765920-154eb600-8b3c-11ea-90d4-a64224d31a5b.png)

Notice how when you first visit the
[`auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/admin`](https://auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/admin)
page, your browser is _redirected_ to:
https://dwylauth.herokuapp.com/?referer=https://auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/admin&auth_client_id=etc.
The auth service handles the actual authentication
and then transparently redirects back to
[`auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/admin?jwt=etc.`](https://auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/admin)
with a JWT session.

For more detail on how the `Auth` service works,
please see: https://github.com/dwyl/auth

If you get stuck during setup,
clone and run our fully working example:
https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug_example#how

<br />

## 1. Installation üìù

Add **`auth_plug`**
to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:auth_plug, "~> 1.5"}
  ]
end
```

Once you've saved the `mix.exs` file,
download the dependency with:

```sh
mix deps.get
```

<br />

## 2. Get Your `AUTH_API_KEY` üîë

Visit: 
[https://authdemo.fly.dev/](https://authdemo.fly.dev/apps/new)
and create a **New App**.
Once you have an App,
you can export an `AUTH_API_KEY` environment variable.
e.g:

![dwyl-auth-app-api-key-setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/93143513-0712c800-f6e0-11ea-9020-c253805d66df.gif)

### 2.1 Save it as an Environment Variable

Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of your app
and add the following line:

```txt
export AUTH_API_KEY=2cfxNaWUwJBq1F4nPndoEHZJ5Y/2cfxNadrhMZk3iaT1L5k6Wt67c9ScbGNP/dwylauth.herokuapp.com
```

The run the following command in your terminal:

```
source .env
```

That will export the environment variable AUTH_API_KEY.

Remember to add `.env` to your [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug/blob/1ebb60938487da7e740a79b2a4639b29f2ba44ac/.gitignore#L52) file.
e.g:

```
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

<br />

## 3. Add `AuthPlug` to Your `router.ex` file to Protect a Route üîí

Open the `lib/app_web/router.ex` file and locate the section:

```elixir
  scope "/", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end
```

Immediately below this add the following lines of code:

```elixir
  pipeline :auth, do: plug(AuthPlug)

  scope "/", AppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    pipe_through :auth
    get "/admin", PageController, :admin
  end
```

> E.g:
> [`/lib/app_web/router.ex#L23-L29`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug_example/blob/8ce0f10e656b94a93b8f02af240b3897ce23c006/lib/app_web/router.ex#L23-L29)

#### _Explanation_

There are two parts to this code:

1. Create a new pipeline called `:auth` which will execute the `AuthPlug`.
2. Create a new scope where we `pipe_through`
   both the `:browser` and `:auth` pipelines.

This means that the `"/admin"` route is protected by `AuthPlug`.

> **Note**: Ensure the route you are protecting works _without_ `AuthPlug`.
> If in doubt simply comment out the line `pipe_through :auth` to check.

<br />

## 4. Attempt to view the protected route to test the authentication! üë©‚Äçüíª

Now that the `/admin` route is protected by **`auth_plug`**,
attempt to view it in your browser e.g: http://localhost:4000/admin

If you are not already authenticated,
your browser will be redirected to:
https://dwylauth.herokuapp.com/?referer=http://localhost:4000/admin&auth_client_id=etc

Once you have successfully authenticated with your GitHub or Google account,
you will be redirected back to `localhost:4000/admin`
where the `/admin` route will be visible.

![admin-route](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/80760439-d23b1580-8b30-11ea-8941-160ece8a4a5f.png)

<br />

## That's it!! üéâ

You just setup auth in a Phoenix app using **`auth_plug`**!

If you got stuck or have any questions,
please
[open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug/issues),
we are here to help!

## _Optional_ Auth

The use case shown above is protecting an endpoint
that you don't want people to see if they haven't authenticated.
If you're building an app that has routes
where you want to show generic content to people who have _not_ authenticated,
but then show more detail/custom actions to people who _have_ authenticated,
that's where _Optional_ Auth comes in.

To use _optional_ auth it's even _easier_ than required auth.

Open your `lib/app_web/router.ex` file and add the following line
above the routes you want show optional data on:

```elixir
pipeline :authoptional, do: plug(AuthPlugOptional, %{})
```

e.g:
[`/lib/app_web/router.ex#L13`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug_example/blob/f4c79e540ed8ef2d4c587647b31e93fec9855f59/lib/app_web/router.ex#L13)

Then add the following line to your main router scope:

```elixir
pipe_through :authoptional
```

e.g:
[`/lib/app_web/router.ex#L17`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug_example/blob/f4c79e540ed8ef2d4c587647b31e93fec9855f59/lib/app_web/router.ex#L17)

That's it now you can check for `conn.assigns.person` in your templates
and display relevant info/actions to the person if they are logged in.

```html
<%= if Map.has_key?(@conn.assigns, :person) do %> Hello <%=
@conn.assigns.person.givenName %>! <% end %>
```

e.g:
[`/lib/app_web/templates/page/optional.html.eex#L2-L3`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug_example/blob/f4c79e540ed8ef2d4c587647b31e93fec9855f59/lib/app_web/templates/page/optional.html.eex#L2-L3)

<br />
Try it: http://auth-plug-example.herokuapp.com/optional

<br />

## Using with `LiveView`

If you are using **`LiveView`**,
having socket assigns with this info
is useful for conditional rendering.
For this, you can use the 
`assign_jwt_to_socket/3` function
to add the `jwt` information to the socket,
e.g:

```elixir
socket = socket
  |> AuthPlug.assign_jwt_to_socket(&Phoenix.Component.assign_new/3, jwt)
```

This will add a `person` object with information
about the authenticated person. 
Here is the assigns should look like
after calling this function.

```elixir
socket #=> #Phoenix.LiveView.Socket<
  id: 123,
  ...
  assigns: %{
    __changed__: %{loggedin: true, person: true},
    loggedin: true,
    person: %{
      aud: "Joken",
      email: "person@dwyl.com",
      exp: 1701020233,
      iat: 1669483233,
      iss: "Joken",
      jti: "2slj49u49a3f3896l8000083",
      nbf: 1669483233,
      session: 1,
      username: "username",
      givenName: "Test Smith",
      username: "dwyl_username"
    }
  },
  transport_pid: nil,
  ...
>
```

## Using with an `API`

Although you'll probably use this package
in scopes that are piped through
`:browser` pipelines,
it can still be used in APIs - 
using a pipeline that only accepts `json` requests.
Like so:

```elixir
  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/api", AppWeb do
    pipe_through [:api]

    resources "/items", ItemController, only: [:create, :update]
  end
```

You may create a pipeline using `auth_plug`,
either be it for normal or optional authentication.
However, this pipeline 
**has to to use the [`fetch_session`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#fetch_session/2) plug**
for `auth_plug` to work.

For example,
if you wanted to pipe your API scope 
inside your `router.ex` file
with `:authOptional`...

```elixir
  scope "/api", AppWeb do
    pipe_through [:api, :authOptional]

    resources "/items", ItemController, only: [:create, :update]
  end
```

it should be defined as such:

```elixir
  pipeline :authOptional do
    plug :fetch_session
    plug(AuthPlugOptional)
  end
```

## Clone

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/auth_plug.git
```

Create a `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env_sample .env
source .env
```

Run the test with coverage:

```sh
mix c
```


<br />

## Available information

By default using the 
[`auth`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth)
authentication service,
`auth_plug` makes the following information available in `conn.assigns`:

```
jwt :: string()
person :: %{
  id :: integer() # This stays unique across providers
  auth_provider :: string()
  email :: string()
  givenName :: string()
  picture :: string()

  # Also includes standard jwt metadata you may find useful:
  aud, exp, iat, iss
}
```

<br />

# Testing / CI

If you are using `GitHub CI`
to _test_ your Auth Controller code
that invokes any of the `AuthPlug.Token` functions - 
and you should be ... -
then you will need to make the 
`AUTH_API_KEY` accessible to `@dependabot`.

Visit: `https://github.com/{org}/{project}/settings/secrets/dependabot`
e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/mvp/settings/secrets/dependabot

And add the `AUTH_API_KEY` environment variable, 
e.g: 

![github-settings-dependabot-secrets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/213398407-7f66ed6e-a7bd-4920-b4c0-27a635c6d98d.png)
